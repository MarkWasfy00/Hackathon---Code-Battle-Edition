## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is Agora?

Agora is a real time engagement platform that provides us with all the tools for building like **Audio and Video calling** along with real time data signaling right into your apps.

With agora you get SDKs and low-code tools to build all sorts of video calling features like group chats with screen sharing and recording, streaming to 3rd party platforms like YouTube and so much more.

### What does agora offer?

‚úÖ  Audio & Video calling SDK: [Agora RTC](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/landing-page?platform=Web)

‚úÖ  Real Time Messaging SDK: [Agora RTM](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/landing-page?platform=Web)

Agora provides a lot more than the two SDK's mentioned above but for the sake of this hackathon I'll leave it at that. 

Using the Agora RTC SDK you are able to leverage the Agora network and tools provide to make integrating audio and video calls into your apps easier than ever.

### Does Agora have a free tier?

Yes! Agora has a generous free tier of 10,000 free usage minutes each month. This should be more thank enough to build what you need for the hackathon.

### Agora Platforms

Agora provides SDK's for various platforms such as Web, Android, IO's, Flutter & much more. When selecting an SDK you will see an entire list of available platforms.

Although you can build with any platform you want I'll assume the majority of the audience here will choose the "Web" platform for building a video calling website.
